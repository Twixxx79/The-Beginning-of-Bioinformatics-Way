# Bioinformatics 
is a new science created from the marriage of Data Science and Biology. Through this emerging field of study, scientists are able to find and decode hidden information in our very own genes, allowing us to understand what none before us have known (<i>from Biostar Handbook 2nd Edition </i>).

Bioinformatics This specialization covers the concepts and tools to understand, analyze, and interpret data from next generation sequencing experiments. It teaches the most common tools used in genomic data science including how to use the command line, Python, R, Bioconductor, and Galaxy. The sequence is a stand alone introduction to genomic data science or a perfect compliment to a primary degree or postdoc in biology, molecular biology, or genetics.Course Certificates
